# BioInformatics - Baum Welch Algorithm

This repository contains my solutions to a 3nd year coursework assignment on BioInformatics at **Durham University.**

## Outline

The aim of the coursework was to implement the Baum-Welch algorithm to allow an approximation for the transition matrix, emmision matrix and starting probabilities of a Hidden Markov Model. The implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/boyla950/bioinformatics_coursework/blob/main/baum-welch.py). The assignment also consisted of a [report](https://github.com/boyla950/bioinformatics_coursework/blob/main/report.py) which explains the workings of the Baum-Welch algorithm.

## Feedback
The final mark received was **72%**.

(In addition to the implementation and report, the assignment contained a question sheet which has not been published here but did contribute the overall mark)
